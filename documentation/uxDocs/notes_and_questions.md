- It is difficult to schedule meetings with debate and ethics bowl students
- Obtain meetings times
- Finding times that work for the Ethics Bowl team
- Obtain blocked times
- Determine severity of blockage
- Prioritizing times
- “Degree of availability” (AKA “Bob”)

  - Which of these displays do you like best? 
    - What do you like about them?
