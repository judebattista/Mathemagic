# Meeting notes 
Josh and Alyssa\
Dr. Ingram, 3/10/20 11AM in Lindaman 

## General rules for schedules
- Dr. Ingram originally would go to the registrar and get a printout of each students' schedule and go through them individually to stake out open times for meetings and schedule them.
- More debaters, so debate schedule is figured out first
- Occasionally, some ethics bowlers are also debaters
- Ethics bowl schedule is more flexible, but want to set times at beginning of semester
- Not all Ethics Bowl meetings have to have every member, and Dr. Ingram doesn't have to attend all of them
  - Sometimes Wyma oversees Ethics Bowl meetings, so it should be possible to schedule meetings when Dr. Ingram is unavailable
- Same place meeting time- no need to include location information
- 8AM - 8PM time frame for schedules (Meetings should be able to start at 8AM and end before 8PM)
- 5-day weekday view preferred
- Used a block-schedule style excel spreadsheet printout to do scheduling by hand
  - Prefers visual blocks 
  - Wants to see all hours of day as opposed to just knowing if there’s an event or not
  - Only needs to see one name of student- first or last
- In the past, manual schedule change for preferred times
  - Would prefer to have a group chat to arrange conflicts/unpreferred times, and then go into the app manually and make changes
- Meeting times should be in either hour or 45 minute blocks
- Schedule is mostly static and set at the beginning of the semester
  - Week-by-week updates only occur when a student can't make the regular time
- 22+ roughly people [mostly students] using the app for debate, ethics bowl has roughly 6

## Potential avenues
- Be able to switch students in and out (add or drop), students can see others schedules (Might need permission)?
  - Have students be able to swap times with other students? Swap students schedules if unable to make specific times

## App-related information
- Assistant coaches having access to debate would be nice (if complicated don’t add) 
  - There are new assistant coaches every year
  - Assistant coaches are only for speech and debate
- Minimal involvement/interaction in the app
- Would rather know directly- email over having the app switch student meeting times or notify of missing appointments
- Sees ethics bowl and debate as two separate entities- debate team should only see debate and vice versa
- Schedules one person at a time
- Mostly working from computer, though students will likely edit from their phones
- Upload his schedule first, drop students in and update schedule as he goes.

## I don't know what these mean
- Debate MW 9
- Ethics bowl start at 8
