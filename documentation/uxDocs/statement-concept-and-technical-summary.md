# Statement concept and technical summary

## Product Concept Statement
- Technical document, press release, blog post, or README
- Clear and concise (100 - 150 words)
- Mission statement/ vision statement
- Explain the product to outsiders
- Yardstick to set focus and scope for development
- Broad audience(high-level management, marketing, board of directors, stockholders, general public)
- Iterative process

Answer the following questions:
1.	What is the product or system name?
2.	Who are the users?
3.	How will they use it?
4.	System: What problem(/s) will the system solve (broadly including business objectives)?
5.	Product: What are the major attractions to or distinguishing features of this product?
6.	What is the design vision and what are the emotional impact goals? In other words, what experience will the product or system provide to the user?
	
## Technical Document
You can further motivate usefulness and capabilities in terms of what users will be able to do. Make it clear if the system exists or not. The audience for this part is me (your boss, the project manager). This writeup should be a little bit larger and it should be more technical and more complete than the system concept statement above.
