# Requirements extracted from the 10 March interview with Mike Ingram
**BOLD** listings are direct requirements.  
*Italic* listings are derived requirements.  
## UI requirements
**Primary view should be a five day display**
* No weekends by default
* 0800-2000
* Hours are not atomic  
    * Need to explore five minute intervals versus fifteen minute  

**Visual block display**  
* Blocks should be distinguished by color  
    * Color by participant would be ideal  
        * This may be a problem given the number of people involved  
        * May need to explore other indicators  

**Should support Drag and Drop interactions**  


## General Requirements
**Ethics Bowl and Speech/Debate should be treated separately**
* Initial proiposal from Dr. Ingram is to have two entirely separate calendars
* In the general case, we should have the capability of combining calendars into a single view

*Meeting locations should all have a default*
* If the the location ever changes from the default, the meeting should have an indicator
* Meeting participants should also be notified
** Need to find out whether the location change email can be automated or whether Dr. Ingram would prefer manual communication

*Need to determine how to handle notifications when a student swaps slots*
* Who gets notified?
* Manual or automatic notification?

**Establish roles and permissions**
* Coach
* Assistant Coach
* Debaters
* Bowlers
* Debater/Bowlers
    * Do we need a separate category for students in both roles, or can we do a union on the two individual roles?

*Student availibility should be a spectrum, not binary*

*Attendance priority should be a spectrum, not binary*

*In Ethics Bowl, students are assigned to different cases. In the event that a student cannot make a meeting, we should facilitate swapping meeeting times with a team assigned to a different case.*

**After the initial creation, changes to the schedule tend to be rare (less than ten per semester)**

**We need to consider which groups have priority in scheduling**
* Currently, Dr. Ingram schedules Speech/Debate first, then Ethics Bowl
    * Given the relative complexities, we may want to reconsider this

**Off-campus access to the application is strongly desired**
* Keep Dr. Ingram informed of this status
