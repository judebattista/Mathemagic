## Product Concept Statement
*A short, fundamental idea of what you are trying to achieve*. Product concept statements provide a concise overview of the mission, purpose, direction or strategy for a product. Think of it as a pitch addressed to a general non-technical audience. They can be as brief as a few sentences, but never longer than a page.

Include: 
1. Who the users are and how they will use the product
2. The main problems users are facing (Rather than broadly saying "It is hard to schedule meetings with lots of people", relate to audience-specific details and the context of the issue)
3. Why the product is necessary- this is where you discuss how your product addresses the problem, its distinguishing features, comparisons to existing solutions, and the beneficial experience your product will provide to target users.

**Example**: 
"The BBC provides a range of television, radio, and online services and are most prominently known for news reporting as well as producing original content. Although they create content across their many channels for all demographics, engagement is lower amongst 15-24 year olds. This is an industry wide shift; millennials are turning away from traditional broadcasting in favor of online media. So, we created BBC Micro, which redefines how your daily news is delivered. This mobile application let's you receive customized, bite-sized content twice a day through interactive notifications."

## Value Proposition Canvas

Related to the project concept, but intended for internal use to understand the product from the user's perspective.
"A value proposition is the place where your company’s product intersects with your customer’s desires. It’s the magic fit between what you make and why people buy it. Your value proposition is the crunch point between business strategy and brand strategy... A “value proposition canvas” is a chart that maps the key things that make up your product and why people buy it. There are many different value proposition canvases... Any canvas that helps you understand your customer, your offer and how the two fit together will help you clarify your value proposition."

Example questions to help create a Value Proposition Canvas:
1. How does your product work?
2. What does your product do for your customers?
3. What does it feel like to use your product?
4. What are the rational drivers of purchasing?
5. What are the emotional drivers of purchasing?
6. What are your customers hidden needs?
7. What do people currently do instead?

## Competitive Analysis

Definition: “Identifying your competitors and evaluating their strategies to determine their strengths and weaknesses relative to those of your own product or service.” Running a competitive analysis can help identify points of success or failure in similar products, and provide a basic understanding of general conventions and best practices. 

A typical competitor table contains the following:
1. Competitor’s name
2. Competitor’s URL
3. The number of users/downloads — mainly to identify the effectiveness of the platform
4. Number of years the platform or product has been in use (optional)
5. The main features being offered by competitors
6. Cost of service/product
7. Additional notes
