## Notes from UX meeting 24 April 2020
### __Overview__
#### Conclusions:
- Use Alyssa's layout
- Use a secondary display
- We need to consider personnel and team/group management functions
  
#### Outstanding Questions:
- How do we organize groups and teams?
- What permissions should groups and teams have?
- What does the data model look like?
- How should time and data relationships impact each view?

#### Current Tasks:
- Update the figma document with wireframe objects

### __Wireframe comparison__
We decided to start with Alyssa's general layout.
- Expandable menu
- Informational header
- Date range in header, rather than dates on days

We investigated the possibility of a secondary display, and concluded it would be useful both for showing more detailed information and allowing the user to update groups, users, and meetings.
- Overlay (Google Calendar)
- Tiling
Either option should reduce the number of separate pages required to implement full functionality.

### __Menu Design__
- Hamburger
- Expandable
- Primary access point to all major functionality

### __Schedule conflict representation__
- Primarily color driven
  - Color combination versus a standard conflict color.
- Consider primary versus secondary displays

### __Display driven by time versus data relationships__
We believe the week view should probably have fixed time intervals allowing the user to accurately assess temporal relationships at a glance. for secondary display of days, a data-driven display is feasible as preserving screen real estate may become more important than displaying fixed time slots.

### __Questions for Dr. Ingram__
- Are multiple access points for functionality useful or redundant?
  - Menu or context preferable?
